It store key value pairs.
key -> humari unique value hogi
value -> same bhi ho sakti hai and unique bhi  

HashMaps are the unordered maps. 


insertion in HashMap
-->> exist -> value got updated
-->> dosen't -> creates the new key value pair and insert it
for insertion we use "put"


IMPLEMENTATION OF HASHMAPS 
Time Complexity -->>> O(1)
put() --->> to add data in the HashMap
get() -->> to get data from the hashmaps
containsKey() -->> to find the that the hashmaps contains key or not
remove() -->> to remove any key value pair 
size() -->> to find the total pairs in a hashmap
keySet() -->> give the key set in a hashmap



In hashmap the data is stored in the form of "Array of Linked List" -->> internal implementio  of hashmap

In hashmap data is stoed in form of "Busckets"


put -->> exist -->> updates 
    -->> dosen't exist -->> add new (key, value) pair


hashing is basically changing the from of something 

Rehashing mai agar array ka size change hota h toh bucket index bhi change ho sakta haiiii
