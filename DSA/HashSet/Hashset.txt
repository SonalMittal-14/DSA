HashSet is the data structure which have unique values and does not allows dublicates.
Its is one of the importanat data structutre.

HashSet makes no garantees as to the iteration order of the set. in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.

Time Complexity of HashSet    | Array  | Sorted Array
-->> Insert/Add : O(1)        | O(1)   | O(n)
-->> Search/Conatin : O(1)    | O(n)   | O(log n)
-->> Delete/Remove : o(1)     | O(n)   | O(n)


->>> If we want to search anything in a set then we use the function "contains"

--->> if we want to delet anything from the set then we have the fucnction "remove".


-->>> ITERATOR
It has two main function ->> "hasNext" and "next"

"next" agar hum karenge toh vo next value return karega like agar array h [1,2,3] toh next ka use karenge toh 
it.next karenge toh 1 return karnega uske baad aage ki value 

"hasNext" true/false return karta h agar value hogi toh true nahi toh false.


while(it.hasNext()){
    print(it.next());
}
