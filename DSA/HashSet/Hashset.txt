HashSet is the data structure which have unique values and does not allows dublicates.
Its is one of the importanat data structutre.

Time Complexity of HashSet    | Array  | Sorted Array
-->> Insert/Add : O(1)        | O(1)   | O(n)
-->> Search/Conatin : O(1)    | O(n)   | O(log n)
-->> Delete/Remove : o(1)     | O(n)   | O(n)


->>> If we want to search anything in a set then we use the function "contains"

--->> if we want to delet anything from the set then we have the fucnction "remove".
