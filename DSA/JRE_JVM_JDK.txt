Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language.

Java is known for its "Write once , Run anywhere" capability, java code can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This platform independence is one of the Java's Biggest strength.

When you install JDK , you are installing JVM and JRE.

JDK -> The java development kit is a comprehensive software development environment used for developing java applications. It includes everything you need to develop java programs, including : 
-> The java compiler (javac) to convert java source code (.java files) into bytecodes (.class files)
-> Development tools like debugger, documentation generator (javadoc).
-> Source files for java core classes 
-> the JRE (which includes the JVM)


JRE -> Java Runtime Environment
The JRE is what's needed to run java applications on the computer. it consists of :
-> The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
-> Compiled code classes (like strings, integer, Arraylist etc) and supporting files (like Configuration files that tell java how to run)
-> No development tools (unlike JDK) -> it's means for end users who just want to run java applications
-> JRE can be installed without JDK (Java Development Kit) since JRE is only needed to run java applications, while JDK is needed to develop them.


JVM -> Java Virtual Machine 
JVM is the actual engine that runs the Java bytecodes on any platform.

basically , 
JDk ke andar h:
    development tools (javac, etc)
    source code 
    JRE ke andar h :
        JVM 
        core classes (compiled)
        Supporting files


To Summarize :
-> JDK contains JRE , which contains JVM.
-> Developers needed JDK to create Java Applications.
-> End users only need JRE to run Java Applications.
-> JVM is the actual engine that runs the java bytecodes on any platform.


A java program runs through a clear pipeline : 
-> Source code is written in .java files.
-> Compilation transforms it into platform-independent bytecodes (.class)
-> Execution  is handled by the JVM , which interprets or compiles the bytecodes into native code for the specific operating system and hardware, allowing the program to run seamlessly across the different environment.
